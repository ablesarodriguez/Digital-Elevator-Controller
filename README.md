# Digital-Elevator-Controller
## Course Description

This course introduced us to digital logic, basic data representation, and how computers process information at a fundamental level. We covered binary systems, logic gates, and the inner workings of a CPU.

## Practical Work

For the practical project, we designed a digital elevator controller using Quartus. The goal was to create a circuit capable of detecting the elevator's current floor and displaying it on a seven-segment display. The controller handled button inputs for selecting floors and managed door operations automatically based on movement logic.

The system was implemented using:

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs):** Defined the different states of the elevator (idle, moving up, moving down, door opening, door closing).
- **Combinational and Sequential Logic:** Used logic gates and flip-flops to process inputs and control outputs.
- **Seven-Segment Display:** Showed the current floor dynamically as the elevator moved.

The implementation ensured that the elevator operated correctly under different scenarios, such as receiving multiple floor requests, maintaining priority logic, and handling door safety conditions.
